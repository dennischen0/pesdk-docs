Typesetting brought to the next level. The PhotoEditor SDK is equipped with an innovative text layout engine that automatically renders entered text to stunningly beautiful typography. The 10 layout templates featuring 20+ fonts and stickers, hand selected and styled by Art Director Tommi Gutscher, will let your users' creative hearts rejoice. Every upcoming month we'll expand our library and add a new set of templates as part of our Inspirations campaign.
