# Photo Roll

The PhotoEditor SDK comes with a photo roll equipped with a wide range of stock photographies and templates that are presorted in categories. On top of that, the API of the SDK enables you to rearrange the creatives, exchange, reduce or expand the library and provide your users with the most appropriate set of assets for your use-case.
