# Overlays
The PhotoEditor SDKs multifaceted overlay tool can be leveraged to serve many purposes. It can be used to create neat lighting effects such as lens flare, bokeh or light leaks. Overlays can also be used to furnish pictures with textures like crumpled paper or plaster. The PhotoEditor SDK holds a set of 20 preset overlay assets. You can easily expand said library by importing and configuring your own set of overlay assets.
