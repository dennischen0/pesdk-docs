# Overview

Our photo editor is a powerhorse. It comes with unmatched performance using WebGL as primary
rendering engine, and canvas as fallback. All essential photo editing functions are bundled into a
beautiful, simple and skinnable UI. The editor is easily extensible and customizable via API as
described in the following sections.

ECMAScript 6 standard. If you're using an older ECMAScript / JavaScript standard, please use
