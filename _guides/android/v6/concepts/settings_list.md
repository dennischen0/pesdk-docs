The PhotoEditor SDK allows you to change all settings before starting or running the editor.
For this, there are two different Models the SettingsList and the StateHandler. Booth has internally a HashMaps that hold Settings and States (only the StateHandler)

Before you can start the Editor or Camera, you have to pass a `SettingsList` to the `PhotoEditorBuilder` or the `CameraPreviewBuilder` calling the method `setSettingsList(SettingsList settingsList)`.
While starting the Editor this `SettingsList` and all holded settings classes are [parceled](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html) into a bytestream.
After starting the Editor the parceled SettingsList is readed into a StateHandler.

The StateHandler is used internaly to modifying all settings and states. Modifiying settings on a `Settings` class contained in the `StateHandler` then trigger events to update the preview and change export.

To modify Settings you have to obtain a `Settings` class by `getSettingsModel(Class<StateClass> stateClass)` the StateHandler avaliable while runtime has also a methode `getStateModel(@NonNull Class<StateClass> stateClass)` to get state classes (states are not parceld and only available while runtime)
