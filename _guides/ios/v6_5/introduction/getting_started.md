# Getting Started with the PhotoEditor SDK for iOS

## Requirements

* Major Version 3 of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 7.x and Swift 2.2 and iOS 8 and above.
* Major Version 4 of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 8.x and Swift 2.3 and iOS 8 and above.
* Major Version 5 of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 8.x and Swift 3.0 and iOS 8 and above.
* Major Version 6 of the SDK is compatible with Xcode 8.x and Swift 3.0 and iOS 9 and above.

The major version number change from 3.x to 4.x and 5.x was required to provide a release for each Swift version. Version 3.3.12, 4.0.7 and 5.0.7 all have the same features and only differ in the version of Swift used. Major version 6 is the first version with new and updated features and is written in Swift 3.0.

## CocoaPods

PhotoEditor SDK is available via CocoaPods. If you're new to CocoaPods, [this Getting Started Guide will help you](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). CocoaPods is the preferred and simplest way to use the PhotoEditor SDK.

**Important:** Please make sure that you have a CocoaPods version >= 0.39.0 installed. You can check your version of CocoaPods with `pod --version`.

Here's what you have to add to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'imglyKit', '~> 6.5'
```

Then run `pod install`.

## Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency manager, you can integrate
PhotoEditor SDK into your project manually via a dynamic framework.

1) Download the SDK [here](https://github.com/imgly/pesdk-ios-build/releases/latest), then just drag `imglyKit.framework` into the `Embedded Binaries` section of your target:

![Embedded Binaries](/assets/images/guides/{{page.platform}}/{{page.version}}/embedded-binaries.png)

2) Add a new `Run Script Phase` in your targetâ€™s `Build Phases`.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure this `Run Script Phase` is below the `Embed Frameworks` build phase.
You can drag and drop build phases to rearrange them.
Paste the following line in this `Run Script Phase`'s script text field:

```bash
bash "$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/$FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH/imglyKit.framework/strip-framework.sh"
```

This script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries.

# Setup

Our SDK provides two main view controllers. One to work with the camera and one to edit an image.
In the following section we will first explain how the licensing works 
and then how the basic view controllers are set up. We will also demonstrate how they can be embedded into a `UINavigationController`.

## License file

Before using any components of the PhotoEditor SDK, you have to unlock the SDK using your license key file. It is important that you set the license key before using any of the SDK classes.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
  if let licenseURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "license", withExtension: "") {
    PESDK.unlockWithLicense(at: licenseURL)
  }

  return true
}
```

The license is digitally signed so it can not be altered without becoming invalid. 
Our sample app comes with its own license, so you can try that right away. 
To try our SDK in your own app, you need to request a trial license because a license is bound to a bundle identifier. You can request a demo license at [https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/pricing](https://www.photoeditorsdk.com/pricing).

Once you have the license file it can be used to unlock the view controller.
The following example demonstrates the unlock the SDK.

## Add Import Statement
You need to add an import statement like this:

```swift
import imglyKit
```

## Add a CameraViewController

The `CameraViewController` class is responsible for displaying an interface to interact with the camera. It provides user interface elements among others to enable the flash, toggle the camera and choose a filter. All you have to do is the following:

```swift
let cameraViewController = CameraViewController()
present(cameraViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

The `CameraViewController` has a `completionBlock` property. When it is set to `nil`, the taken photo is passed to the `PhotoEditViewController`, which is then presented modally.

## Add a PhotoEditViewController

The `PhotoEditViewController` class is responsible for presenting and rendering an image. It is designed to work together with a `ToolbarController`, which is responsible to presenting and dismissing the various tool controllers.

To present an `PhotoEditViewController` just add these few lines:

```swift
let sampleImage = UIImage(named: "sample_image")

let photoEditViewController = PhotoEditViewController(photo: sampleImage!)
photoEditViewController.delegate = self
        
let toolbarController = ToolbarController()
toolbarController.push(photoEditViewController, animated: false)

present(toolbarController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Here we set the `delegate` of the `photoEditViewController` instance to `self`.
That means that the presenting view controller must implement the `PhotoEditViewControllerDelegate` protocol.
The methods of the `PhotoEditViewControllerDelegate` protocol are designed to inform the delegate about the result of the editing process (for example cancelation).
 
The method that gets called when the user confirms the changes is 
`func photoEditViewController(_ photoEditViewController: PhotoEditViewController, didSave image: UIImage, and data: Data)`.
It provides the resulting image as an `UIImage` and a `Data` object. Please note that the EXIF data of the input image, is only fully contained within the `Data` object. Please refer to the next section for more information about EXIF handling.

## Embed in an UINavigationController

The controllers provided with the SDK can be embedded in an `UINavigationController`. The following code demonstrates how.

```swift
let sampleImage = UIImage(named: "sample_image")
        
let photoEditViewController = PhotoEditViewController(photo: sampleImage!)
photoEditViewController.delegate = self

let toolbarController = ToolbarController()
toolbarController.push(photoEditViewController, animated: false)

let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: toolbarController)
navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle = .black
navigationController.navigationBar.isTranslucent = false

present(navigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

To try these examples, and find out about more options please take a look at the sample project provided [here](https://github.com/imgly/imgly-sdk-ios).
